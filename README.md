Memory allocation using Best Fit algorithm.

# Best Fit Memory Allocation in C

This repository contains a C implementation of the Best Fit memory allocation algorithm. The program manages memory allocation, deallocation, and compaction using a linked list structure.

## Description

The program simulates a memory allocation system where memory is allocated to different programs based on their requirements using the Best Fit strategy. The Best Fit algorithm allocates the smallest available memory block that can accommodate the requested size, thus minimizing wasted space.

## Features

- **Memory Allocation**: Allocate memory to programs based on their size requirements.
- **Memory Deallocation**: Free up memory that is no longer in use.
- **Memory Compaction**: Reorganize memory to eliminate fragmentation and consolidate free space.
- **Dynamic Memory Management**: Uses a linked list to manage memory blocks dynamically.
